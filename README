Nigraha is content management framework that aims at automating several
routines that take place in a university, with a specific emphasis on
Indian Colleges. The system is currently in place and functioning at
the Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur.

Nigraha was under active development from 2005-2008, primarily under
the umbrella of the MNIT FOSS Labs. We have found that existing generic
frameworks for university automation do not fit the needs of Indian
Universities very well, and extensive customization is almost always
required. Hence, Nigraha was built from ground-up on the basis of a loose
coupling between data sources and the actions that can be performed on them.
